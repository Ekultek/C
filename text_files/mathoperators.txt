These are your basic math operations, plus I put () in with these 
since it calls a function and is close to a "math" operation.

()
    Function call.
* (binary)
    multiply.
/   divide.

+ (binary)
    addition.
    
+ (unary)
    positive number.
    
++ (postfix)
    read, then increment.
    
++ (prefix)
    increment, then read.
    
-- (postfix)
    read, then decrement.
    
-- (prefix)
    decrement, then read.
    
- (binary)
    subtract.
    
- (unary)
    negative number.
