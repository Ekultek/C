Some control structures

do-while (do { ... } while (x);)
int main(void)
{
    int x = 5;
    
    do { printf(x++) } while(x > 6)
    
    return 0;
}

break used in loops to end the looping

continue stops the loop and jumps to the testing phase

goto jumps to a spot in the code where you've placed a label
