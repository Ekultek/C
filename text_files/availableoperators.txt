This is a comprehensive list of all the operators you have in the C language. 
In this list, I'm indicating the following:

(binary)
    The operator has a left and right: X + Y.
    
(unary)
    The operator is on its own: -X.
    
(prefix)
    The operator comes before the variable: ++X.
    
(postfix)

    Usually the same as the (prefix) version, but placing it
    after gives it a different meaning: X++.
    
(ternary)

    There's only one of these, so it's actually called the
    ternary but it means "three operands": X ? Y : Z.
