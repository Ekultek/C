unsigned
    Changes the type so that it does not have negative numbers, 
    giving you a larger upper bound but nothing lower than 0.
    
signed
    Gives you negative and positive numbers, but halves your 
    upper bound in exchange for the same lower bound negative.
    
long
    Uses a larger storage for the type so that it can hold bigger
    numbers, usually doubling the current size.
    
short
    Uses smaller storage for the type so it stores less, but takes 
    half the space.
