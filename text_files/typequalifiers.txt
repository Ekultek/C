const
    Indicates the variable won't change after being initialized.
    
volatile
    Indicates that all bets are off, and the compiler should leave 
    this alone and try not to do any fancy optimizations to it. 
    You usually only need this if you're doing really weird stuff 
    to your variables.
    
register
    Forces the compiler to keep this variable in a register, and the 
    compiler can just ignore you. These days compilers are better at 
    figuring out where to put variables, so only use this if you actually 
    can measure it improving the speed.
